Create Sprint Planning Events in Microsoft Teams
=================================================

In Microsoft Teams, from the Calendar tab, choose "New event".

Make sure you select the calendar of the team you are creating a Sprint event for (e.g. Team IT 1: DS Cloud) which you created earlier.

Name the Sprint Planning "Team" + blank space + "DEPARTMENT NAME" + "TEAM NUMBER" + ":" + blank space+ "SERVICE NAME" + blank space + "NICKNAME" + blank space + "-" + blank space + "Sprint Planning".

Where:

- "DEPARTMENT NAME": the name of the department the team is part of, e.g. for "Information Technology" us "IT".
- "TEAM NUMBER": the number of the team for easy of distinguishing between teams.
- "SERVICE NAME": the service the department of which team is part of e.g. for "Developer Services" use "DS".
- "NICKNAME": the name the team uses to be called. For e.g. a Cloud-technology oriented team, use "Cloud".

Example: Team IT 1: DS Cloud - Sprint Planning

Set the Start Date to the first day of the Sprint and set a Start and End Time somewhere during that working day (preferably lasting for no more than 90 minutes). Choose for the event to be a repeating event on a biweekly basis (if your Sprint runs for two weeks), either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. 

If the time of the Sprint Planning does not change during Sprints, you can set the End Date to the very end of the last Sprint of the Year. Otherwise set the End Date to the last day of the last Sprint of the Quarter.

Note: This is NOT and "All day" event.

Recommended: Good practise is to hold your Sprint Planning at the start of your Sprint.

Sprint planning is a time set aside at the beginning of each sprint for the Scrum team to decide what work they will complete in the upcoming iteration. During a sprint planning meeting, Scrum and agile teams accomplish three things:

1. Discuss how to implement a set of product backlog items
2. Determine which set of product backlog items the team can commit to complete during the sprint (or iteration). These items and their tasks become the sprint backlog.
3. Choose and fine-tune the sprint goal to reflect the work of the sprint.

The **purpose of sprint planning** is:
1) to select the right set of product backlog items to work on during the sprint and 
2) to discuss each item enough to feel confident beginning work.

Sprint planning is a time for the team to consider how they will approach doing what the product owner has requested. By contrast, story-writing workshops are when the product owner, stakeholders, and team brainstorm what functionality the customer needs most.

By the end of sprint planning, the team selects how much work they can do in the coming sprint. The product owner does not get to say, "We have four sprints left so you need to do one-fourth of everything I need." It's up to the team to determine how much they can do in the sprint.

The sprint planning meeting is attended by the entire Scrum team, including the product owner, Scrum Master. Outside stakeholders may attend by invitation of the team, although this is rare.

The official answer from the Scrum Guide is that sprint planning can take no more than 8 hours (usually less for shorter sprints).

Eight hours is far too long to spend planning.

Instead, target about **45 minutes of meeting time multiplied by the number of weeks in the sprint**. So a two-week sprint should have a 90-minute sprint planning meeting. And a full four-week sprint (or one month sprint) should target a 3-hour sprint planning timebox.

Comprehensive task lists and precise estimates are not the goal of sprint planning meetings. The purpose of sprint planning is to select the right set of product backlog items and have a rough idea of how to work on them. The team does not need to know every task they'll perform to accomplish this goal. And the team certainly does not need to know if one of those tasks will take 5 hours instead of 4.

During the sprint planning meeting, the product owner describes the highest priority features to the development team.

Then, sprint planning works in one of two general ways: by considering a team's historical velocity or by considering a team's capacity.

A refined and estimated set of product backlog items is the primary input to sprint planning.

There are two artifacts that result from a sprint planning meeting:

1. A sprint goal
2. A sprint backlog

The Calendar Event of the Sprint Planning could have directions to the physical meeting place or a link online meeting for ease of attending.
